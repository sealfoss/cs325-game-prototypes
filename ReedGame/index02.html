<h2>Squishy Ant</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
</li>
<li>I'm sure I've seen games somewhat similiar to this one, but I can't think of any off the top of my head.</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
</li>
<li>I feel like the way the ants move LOOKS way more complex than the underlying logic actually is.</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong></li>
<li>I've gotten a lot more comfortable with JavaScript and phaser. My code is a lot cleaner, I think. Still a lot to learn, though.</li>
<li>Easiest part was bringing in all the assets and getting them to move around. The hardest part was figuring out how to get the sprits to interact with the mouse, disappear, and spawn new sprites.</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
<ul>
<li>All graphics were made from scratch.</li><li> I used a splat sound effect from FreeSound.org</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
</li>
<li> I'm really not sure of a title that's like this. Maybe in a high level way something like whack-a-mole?</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong></li>
<li>Be an ant, don't get smooshed, make it to the smiley face.</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
You're an ant, and they're out to get you! Don't get smooshed!
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
</li>
<li>Initial position of all the ants is random, as is the movement of all NPC ants.</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong></li>
<li>Camouflage one player's movements with randomness from NPC's.</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
</li>
<li>Player One's goal is to evade Player Two, and make it to the smiley face. Player Two's goal is to find Player One and smoosh them.</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
</li>
<li>Player One controls an ant with WASD controlls. The objective for player one is to guide their ant to the smiley face. Player Two controls the mouse, and smooshes ants by clicking on them. If Player 2 smooshes Player 1, Player 2 wins. If Player 1 makes it to the smiley face without gettig smooshed, Player 1 wins.</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
</li>
<li>Strategy of play for Player 1 hinges on hiding in the crowd, like a zebra trying to get away from a lion. Strength in numbers. But as the other ants get smooshed, Player 1 will begin to stick out like a sore thumb. Player 2's strategy relies on picking Player 1 out of the crowd, somehow.</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
</li>
<li>Ants just want to be happy. Unfortuneatly for them, mice hate happy ants, and will kill them at every opportunity. Watch out!</li>


<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
</li>
<li>People who like to be sneaky, and people who like finding other people who are trying to be sneaky.</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
</li>
<li>Maybe a minute or two, max</li>
</ul>
