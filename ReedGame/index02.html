<h2>Squishy Ant</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
</li>
<li>I don't think I've seen a lot of games like this, but it certainly isn't terribly original to make a game with a bunch of mindless enemies that are out to get you.</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
</li>
<li>Objects are constantly moving directly towards the player.</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong></li>
<li>I learned while building this prototype how to set up a web server through npm and the phaser API.</li>
<li>Intalling npm and the webserver were the easiest part of building the prototype. Learning Phaser, and dealing with JavaScript were the hardest parts.</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
<ul>
<li>All graphics were made from scratch.</li><li> I used a splat sound effect from FreeSound.org</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
</li>
<li>The enemies are coming directly at the player at all times without much in the way of AI. The cloest game that comes to mind with that sort of behavior is PAC-MAN (with more degrees of freedom), or maybe the original DOOM game.

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong></li>
<li>Run for your life as a magnet in a world of knives.</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
You're a magnet, and therefore absolutely irresistable to all of the magetized knives in the world. It's the laws of physics!
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
</li>
<li>The blocks are randomly generated after every round.</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong></li>
<li>Relying entirely on the game environment to avoid enemy attacks.</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
</li>
<li>The goal is to have the player strategize how to get away from the knives.</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
</li>
<li>The player can move the character up, down, left, and right (WASD). The character can move anywhere in game space. There are multiple enemies constantly moving directly towards the player. The player must avoid these enemies and make their way to the goal (a smiley face). The environment includes obstacles that will block the enemies which the player can use to their advantage. Obstacles are placed at random every round.</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
</li>
<li>The strategy of play hinges completely on using the environment to your advange. The only way you can get to safety is by gaming the fact that the knives will always move directly towards you, regardless of whether there is something in their way. Use that fact by getting the knives caught behind walls while you make your way to safety.</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
</li>
<li>The life of Maggie the magnet is in the players' hands. The player must guide Maggie to safety, through a world of knives that are out to get them. Should the player fail, the knives will stab poor Maggie to death in a most painful manner. But, no pressure.</li>


<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
</li>
<li>Anyone who wants to stimulate the reward centers of their brain with a high-frequency dopamine loop.</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
</li>
<li>Each round lasts a few seconds a most.</li>
</ul>
